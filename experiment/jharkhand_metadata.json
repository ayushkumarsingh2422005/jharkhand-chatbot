Thus, to ensure sustainability, it is imperative that the future of transportation is electric with zero emissions and carbon footprint. India is actively exploring cost-effective and viable solutions for sustainable development as well as reducing its excessive dependence on oil imports. The Indian EV market is still at a nascent stage, 1Sixth Assessment Report (ipcc.ch) 2 Jharkhand Gazette (Extraordinary), Friday, 7th October, 2022 comprising less than 1% of the total vehicle sales.

However, the EV market has the potential to grow significantly in the coming years, as sales are expected to witness high double-digit growth rates annually till 2030. EVs have emerged as a promising and singular alternative that could help mitigate the adverse environmental impact caused by conventional vehicles. To further drive the growth of EV sector in the country, the Government of India is increasingly pushing to develop appropriate monetary and fiscal responses to promote drive EV adoption in the country. A differential GST regime for EVs has been implemented by the Government of India as it is expected to help electric mobility gain momentum, under it, pure EVs have been kept in the 5% tax slab of the GST."

These rights safeguard intangible assets such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. IPR ensures that creators can benefit from their work and encourages innovation, creativity, and economic growth. History of IPR The roots of IPR can be traced back to ancient civilizations. In Venice (1474), the first patent law was enacted. The Statute of Anne (1710) in England was the first copyright law.
